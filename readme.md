## regression for customer data

### how to display regression
When performing linear regression with multiple parameters, you can display the results in a few different ways to understand the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Here are a few common approaches:

1. Coefficient Estimates: Display the estimated coefficients for each independent variable in the regression equation. These coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other variables constant. You can present these coefficients along with their standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals to assess their statistical significance.

2. Regression Equation: Present the regression equation itself, which shows the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The equation will include the estimated coefficients for each independent variable, along with their corresponding variable names. For example, if you have two independent variables x1 and x2, the equation might be written as: y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2.

3. Scatterplot with Regression Line: Create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between one independent variable and the dependent variable. Add a regression line that represents the best-fit line through the data points. This can help illustrate how the independent variable(s) influence the dependent variable.

4. Residual Plot: Plot the residuals (the differences between the observed values and the predicted values) against the independent variables. This plot helps assess the assumption of homoscedasticity (equal variance) and linearity. If the residuals exhibit a pattern or systematic deviation from randomness, it indicates a violation of these assumptions.

5. R-squared and Adjusted R-squared: Display the R-squared value and adjusted R-squared value, which provide an indication of how well the independent variables explain the variation in the dependent variable. R-squared represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. Adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of independent variables in the model.

These are just a few ways to display and interpret linear regression results with multiple parameters. The choice of presentation depends on the context, audience, and the specific insights you want to convey.

### Theory:
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared are common evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a regression model. Let's understand what these metrics mean and what values you should aim for:

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE):
   - The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It quantifies the overall quality of the predictions.
   - A lower MSE indicates better model performance, as it means the predictions are closer to the actual values.
   - However, the interpretation of the MSE depends on the scale of the dependent variable. Since the MSE is in squared units of the dependent variable, it may not have a direct intuitive interpretation.

2. R-squared:
   - The R-squared (coefficient of determination) measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.
   - It ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variance, and 1 indicates that the model explains all the variance.
   - A higher R-squared value suggests that the model provides a better fit to the data, capturing a larger proportion of the variability.
   - However, R-squared should not be the sole criterion for model evaluation, as it can be misleading. A high R-squared does not guarantee a good model, and a low R-squared does not necessarily imply a poor model.

The ideal values for MSE and R-squared depend on the specific problem, domain, and context. It is challenging to define a universally "good" or "bad" value for these metrics. Generally, you should compare the MSE and R-squared of your model to alternative models or use domain-specific knowledge to assess their adequacy.

In your specific case, a MSE of 1.22 suggests that, on average, the squared difference between the predicted and actual values is around 1.22 units (in the squared scale of your dependent variable). The R-squared value of 0.94 indicates that your model explains approximately 94.3% of the variance in the dependent variable, which is generally considered a good fit.

Remember, it is crucial to interpret these metrics in conjunction with other considerations, such as the nature of the problem, the context of the data, and the specific requirements and expectations of your application.

#### Why do we need noise on test data
Adding noise to the dependent variable (Y) is a common practice in regression modeling. Here's why we add noise:

1. Real-world data variability: In many real-world scenarios, the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is not entirely deterministic. There are often other unaccounted factors or measurement errors that introduce variability or randomness into the data. By adding random noise, we attempt to capture this inherent variability and mimic real-world conditions.

2. Model robustness: Introducing noise helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, capturing both the underlying patterns and random fluctuations in the data. By including noise, the model learns to generalize better to unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.

3. Assumption of residuals: Linear regression assumes that the residuals (the differences between the predicted and actual values) are normally distributed and have constant variance. Adding random noise helps satisfy these assumptions, as the noise contributes to the residuals and ensures they follow a normal distribution.

By adding random noise to the dependent variable, we aim to make our regression model more realistic, better capture the underlying relationships, and account for the variability inherent in real-world data.


#### calculation of linear regression
coefficients = np.linalg.inv(X_train.T @ X_train) @ X_train.T @ Y_train
explain me this

Certainly! Let's break down the expression step by step:

    X_train.T: This is the transpose of the design matrix X_train. Taking the transpose swaps the rows and columns of the matrix.

    X_train.T @ X_train: The @ symbol denotes the matrix multiplication operator in NumPy. This operation computes the matrix product between X_train.T and X_train.

    np.linalg.inv(X_train.T @ X_train): The np.linalg.inv function calculates the inverse of the matrix resulting from X_train.T @ X_train. The inverse of a matrix is used to solve systems of linear equations and find the coefficients in linear regression.

    X_train.T @ Y_train: This computes the matrix product between the transpose of X_train and the target variable Y_train. This operation represents the summation of the cross-products between each independent variable and the target variable.

    np.linalg.inv(X_train.T @ X_train) @ X_train.T @ Y_train: This expression combines the previous steps to calculate the coefficient vector in linear regression. It involves multiplying the inverse of the matrix X_train.T @ X_train with the matrix X_train.T @ Y_train.

Essentially, this expression applies the normal equation in linear regression, which provides a closed-form solution for finding the coefficients. By multiplying the inverse of the matrix of the cross-products of the independent variables (X_train.T @ X_train) with the cross-products of the independent variables and the target variable (X_train.T @ Y_train), we obtain the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared errors.

The resulting coefficient vector represents the estimated regression coefficients, which can be used to make predictions on new data.
